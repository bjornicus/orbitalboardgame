    <p>Populations have grown beyond the capacity of the home planet; it is time to expand into the rest of the solar system. You have the technology, but lack the necesarry resources to build orbital colonies. Unfortunately pirates lurk in the outer ring, and venture into the inner orbits, preying one those they cat catch. You must venture forth into the solar system, gather the necesarry resources, and construct new homes for your people, while defending yourself and your allies from the pirates. . .</p>
    <p>Trajectory is a cooperative game, meaning either everyone wins, or everyone loses.</p>
    <h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
    <p>Work together to collect and transport critical resources in order to construct a orbital colonies while defending the solar system against pirates.</p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Place the six planets at random locations within in their respective orbits: metal planet (red) in the innermost orbit, home planet (earthlike) in the second orbit, helium planets (gas giants) in the third orbit, and ice planets in the outermont orbit.</li>
        <li>Place all of the player's ships in orbit around (on the same space as) the home planet.</li>
        <li>Place a storage ring in orbit in orbit around the home planet.</li>
        <li>Have each player close their eyes and choose a random resource token and place it on one of the spaces on their ship mat.</li>
        <li>Fuel up the ships by filling all of the remaining spots on each player's ship mats with fuel tokens.</li>
        <li>Place all of the action tokens and pirate tokens in the draw bag.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="rounds">Rounds</h2>
    <p>A round of play consists of the following:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Pirate turn: move each pirate piece or harvest pirate resources as described in the 'Pirate Turn' section.</li>
        <li>Player turns: each player takes a turn as described in the 'Player Turns' section.</li>
        <li>Orbit everything (all ships, planets, stations, and pirates) counter clockwise.</li>
        <li>Return any spent action tokens or destroyed pirates to the draw bag.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="player-turns">Player Turns</h2>
    <p>Each player, on their turn takes the following steps:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Draw a token from the draw bag. If it is a pirate token place it on the board on the pirate start space closest to where you are sitting. If it is an action token, keep it until you wish to use it to perform a special action (you may save it for a later turn if you like).</li>
        <li>Do any or all of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>If you are at the home planet, or a refit station, you may re-outfit your ship for a different class. Available classs are miner, interceptor, engineer, or heavy lift. To re-outfit as a miner, interceptor, or engineer, place the appropriate class marker on your ship mat (removing the previous one). To re-outfit as a heavy lift, flip your ship card over so that it shows the side with eight additional fuel/cargo slots.</li>
                <li>Re-fuel your ship (if at the home planet or fuel station).</li>
                <li>Move your ship (once per turn)</li>
                <li>Exchange fuel, cards, or resources with other ships on the same space.</li>
                <li>Move fuel or cargo to or from a storage ring on the same space.</li>
                <li>Load colony provisions onto your ship (if at the home planet).</li>
                <li>Deliver colony provisions to an orbital colony on the same space.</li>
                <li>Perform special actions specific to your ship's class (one per action card)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="ship-movement">Ship movement</h2>
    <p>Each ship may move one space per turn (except interceptors and heavy lift by using action tokens).</p>
    <p>Fuiel costs are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Changing orbits, arriving at a space with no planet - 1/2 of your total weight (fuel + cargo units currently on board your ship)</li>
        <li>Changing orbits, arriving at a planet - 1/4 of your total ship weight</li>
        <li>Changing orbits, departing from an acceleration ring - 1/4 of your total ship weight</li>
        <li>Changing orbits, departing from an acceleration ring and arriving at a planet - 1/8 of your total ship weight.</li>
        <li>Moving within the same orbit)- 1 fuel unit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When computing fuel costs, always round any fractional result to the nearest whole number (but movement aways costs at least one fuel unit).</p>
    <p>If you have too much cargo to move with your remaining fuel, you will need to dump some of it (in which case it is lost) or transfer it to another ship or storage ring on the same space and move without it.</p>
    <h2 id="special-actions">Special actions</h2>
    <p>You may perform as many special actions as you like on your turn, provided you have a token to spend for each action. When performing a special action, place the action token in the middle of the board to be collected and returned to the draw bag at the end of the round.</p>

    <h3 id="adding">Adding</h3>
    <p>When a pirate token is drawn, place it on the board at the pirate start point on the outermost orbit closest to where the player who drew it is sitting.</p>
    <h3 id="moving">Moving</h3>
    <p>Pirates move one space per round closer to their target orbit (denoted by the color shown on the token). Once they reach their target orbit, they move towards the nearest player, station, or planet. Given two equally distant targets, the pirate will move in the orbital direction.</p>
    <p>If a pirate moves onto a space containing a players ship, it immediately captures any resources the player is carying (place them in the pirate resource pile). The pirate also removes all fuel from the player's ship, stranding it until help can arrive. Pirates ignore disabled/empty player ships during movement.</p>

    <h2 id="winning-or-losing">Winning or Losing</h2>
    <p>To win the game, you must construct enough orbital colonies to meet the expansion needs of your population. Once constructed, colony provisions from the home planet must be delivered to a colony to make it ready to be inhabited. The number of colonies you must construct depends on the difficulty you have chosen. The difficulty level also imposes constraints on how many planets you can allow to become infested. Play continues until one of the following happens: * The winning condition is met. * The game is lost due to planetary infestation. * The draw pile is exhausted and all remaining action cards are used.</p>
    <h3 id="winning">Winning</h3>
    <p>The game is won as soon as the players construct the requisite number of habitats:</p>
    <p>Easy: Successfully construct and provision one orbital habitat.</p>
    <p>Normal: Successfully construct and provision two orbital habitat. Do not lose more than two planets to infestation.</p>
    <p>Hard: Successfully construct and provision three orbital habitat. Do not lose more than one planet to infestation.</p>
    <h3 id="losing">Losing</h3>
    <p>If the home planet becomes infested or more than the allowable number of other planets become infested, the game is lost. If the players are unable to construct the necesarry number of habitats before running out of action cards to spend the game is also lost.</p>
