<h3 id="a-six-sided-die">A six sided die</h3>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Place the four planets somewhere in their respective orbits: metal planet (red) in the innermost orbit, home planet (earthlike) in the second orbit, helium planet (gas giant) in the third orbit, and ice planet in the outermont orbit.</li>
<li>Place all of the player's ships in orbit on the home planet.</li>
<li>Fuel up the ships by filling all of the spots on each player's ship mats with fuel tokens.</li>
<li>Separate 12 the infestor cards from the rest of the deck and shuffle them. Divide the rest of the deck (which now should contain only action cards) into three piles of 12. Shuffle two infestor cards into pile one, four into pile two, and six into pile three. Stack the piles with pile three on bottom and pile one on top to form the draw pile.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="rounds">Rounds</h2>
<p>A round of play consists of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Infestor movement turn: move each infestor piece towards its target planet (see 'Infestor' section).</li>
<li>Player turns: each player takes a turn as described below.</li>
<li>Orbit everything (all ships, planets, stations, and infestors) counter clockwise</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="player-turns">Player Turns</h2>
<p>Each player, on their turn takes the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Draw a card. If it is an infestor card add an infestor to the board (See 'Infestors' section for details). If it is an action card, keep it until you wish to use it to perform a special action (you may save it for a later turn if you like).</li>
<li>Do any or all of the following:
<ul>
<li>If you are at the home planet, or a refit depot, you may re-outfit your ship for a different class. Available classs are miner, interceptor, engineer, or heavy lift. To re-outfit as a miner, interceptor, or engineer, place the appropriate class marker on your ship mat (removing the previous one). To re-outfit as a heavy lift, flip your ship card over so that it shows the side with eight additional fuel/cargo slots.</li>
<li>Re-fuel your ship (if at the home planet or fuel depot)</li>
<li>Exchange fuel, cards, or resources with other ships on your same space.</li>
<li>Move your ship (once per turn)</li>
<li>Perform special actions specific to your ship's class (one per action card)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ship-movement">Ship movement</h2>
<p>Move one space per turn (except interceptors, see Interceptor special actions).</p>
<p>Movement costs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orbital transfer maneuver (changing orbits) - ½ of your total weight (fuel + cargo units currently on board your ship)</li>
<li>Orbital transfers into planetary orbit - ¼ of your total ship weight</li>
<li>Orbital transit (within the same orbit)- 1 fuel unit</li>
</ul>
<p>When computing fuel costs, always round any fractional result up to the next whole number.</p>
<p>If you have too much cargo to move with your remaining fuel, you will need to dump some of it or transfer it to another ship or storage depot on your same space and move without it.</p>
<h2 id="special-actions">Special actions</h2>
<p>You may perform as many special actions as you like on your turn, provided you have cards for them. For each action you perform you must discard one action card to perform that action.</p>
<h3 id="mining-ship">Mining ship:</h3>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/class-marker1.png" width="100" height="100" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Search the empty (no planets, stations, or infestors) space your ship occupies for resources by Rolling the die. A resource is discovered if the number rolled is less than or equal to the orbit number (e.g. 1 for innermost, 4 four outermost)
<ul>
<li>If a resource is discovered, place a matching resource token in your cargo hold</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extract resources from the planet you are orbiting (if not infested). One resource per card
<ul>
<li>Water from the outermost planet</li>
<li>Helium 3 from the third planet</li>
<li>Metals from the innermost planet</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Build storage ring on the space your ship occupies, as long as it does not already have a ring or other station. Cost: <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/metal-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" />.</li>
<li>Upgrade a storage ring to a fuel depot. Cost: <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/helium-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" /> + <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/helium-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" />.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interceptor">Interceptor:</h3>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/class-marker2.png" width="100" height="100" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Destroy an invader ship on the same space.</li>
<li>Move an extra space</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="engineer">Engineer:</h3>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/class-marker3.png" width="100" height="100" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Build one of the following on the space your ship occupies, as long as it does not already have a ring or other station:
<ul>
<li>Storage ring ( <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/metal-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" /> )</li>
<li>Fuel depot ( <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/metal-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" /> + <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/helium-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" /> + <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/helium-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" /> )</li>
<li>Refit station ( <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/ice-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" /> + <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/metal-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" /> + <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/helium-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" /> )</li>
<li>Interstellar transport (see winning)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Upgrade a storage ring to any other station type. Cost is same as above minus the metal (e.g. upgrade a ring to a fuel depot for 2 helium).</li>
<li>Disassemble any constructed station and recover the metal</li>
<li>Refit any ship on the same space (including your own)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heavy-lift">Heavy lift:</h3>
<p><img src="https://rawgit.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/ship-card[back].svg" width="100" height="100"></p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy lift ships have 2X the carrying capacity of other ships.</li>
<li>Boost a station you are docked with to a new orbit for a cost of 3 fuel + the normal movement cost for your ship. Storage rings must be empty to boost. Your ship may not re-fuel on the same turn.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>Metals <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/metal-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" /> can be found in the inner ring.</p>
<p>Helium <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/helium-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" /> can be found in the third ring.</p>
<p>Ice <img src="https://rawgithub.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/ice-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" /> can be found in the outer ring.</p>
<h2 id="infestors">Infestors</h2>
<h3 id="adding">Adding</h3>
<p>When an infestor card is drawn, take an infestor token of the corresponding color and place it on the board at the infestation point on the outermost orbit closest to where the player who drew the card is sitting.</p>
<h3 id="moving">Moving</h3>
<p>Infestors move one space per round closer to their target planet (first in to the target orbit then around that orbit). When moving around an orbit, the infestor will take the shortest path to the planet, peferring the orbital direction (counter clockwise) in the case where either direction is the same distance to the planet.</p>
<p>If an infestor reaches a planet, that planet becomes infested and is no longer usable.</p>
<p>If an infestor's target planet is already infested at the beginning of the infestor movement phase (i.e. before any infestors have moved this round), it targets the home planet.</p>
<h2 id="winning">Winning</h2>
<p>Successfully harvest and transport resources to the interstellar transport site:</p>
<p>Easy: 4 water and 2 metals</p>
<p>Normal: 6 water and 3 metals</p>
<p>Hard: 8 water and 4 metals</p>
<h2 id="losing">Losing</h2>
<p>The home planet becomes infested or the players are unable to gather sufficient resources</p>
