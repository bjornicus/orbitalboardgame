Populations have grown beyond the capacity of the home planet; it is time to expand into the rest of the solar system.  You have the technology, but lack the necesarry resources to build orbital colonies. Unfortunately an imminent threat has been been identified! An infestation is approaching which could render the planets unusable.  You must venture forth into the solar system, gather the necesarry resources, and construct new homes for your people, while defending your solar system against this threat. . .

Trajectory is a cooperative game, meaning either everyone wins, or everyone loses.  

##Objective 
Work together to collect and transport critical resources in order to construct a orbital colonies while defending the solar system against the infestation.

##Setup 
1. Place the four planets at random locations within in their respective orbits: metal planet (red) in the innermost orbit, home planet (earthlike) in the second orbit, helium planet (gas giant) in the third orbit, and ice planet in the outermont orbit.
1. Place all of the player's ships in orbit on the home planet.
1. Fuel up the ships by filling all of the spots on each player's ship mats with fuel tokens.
1. Separate the twelve infestor cards from the rest of the deck and shuffle them. Divide the rest of the deck (which now should contain only action cards) into three piles of 12. Shuffle two infestor cards into pile one, four into pile two, and six into pile three. Stack the piles with pile three on bottom and pile one on top to form the draw pile. 

##Rounds
A round of play consists of the following:

1. Infestor movement turn: move each infestor piece towards its target planet (see 'Infestor' section).
1. Player turns: each player takes a turn as described below. 
1. Orbit everything (all ships, planets, stations, and infestors) counter clockwise 

##Player Turns
Each player, on their turn takes the following steps:

1. Draw a card.  If it is an infestor card add an infestor to the board (See 'Infestors' section for details).  If it is an action card, keep it until you wish to use it to perform a special action (you may save it for a later turn if you like). 
1. Do any or all of the following:
    * If you are at the home planet, or a refit depot, you may re-outfit your ship for a different class. Available classs are miner, interceptor, engineer, or heavy lift. To re-outfit as a miner, interceptor, or engineer, place the appropriate class marker on your ship mat (removing the previous one).  To re-outfit as a heavy lift, flip your ship card over so that it shows the side with eight additional fuel/cargo slots.
    * Load colony provisions onto your ship (if at the home planet).
    * Deliver colony provisions to an orbital colony on the same space.
    * Re-fuel your ship (if at the home planet or fuel depot).
    * Exchange fuel, cards, or resources with other ships on the same space.
    * Move fuel or cargo to or from a storage ring on the same space.
    * Move your ship (once per turn)
    * Perform special actions specific to your ship's class (one per action card)

##Ship movement 
Each ship may move one space per turn (except interceptors, see Interceptor special actions).

Fuiel costs are as follows: 

* Changing orbits, arriving at a space with no planet - ½ of your total weight (fuel + cargo units currently on board your ship) 
* Changing orbits, arriving at a planet - ¼ of your total ship weight 
* Changing orbits, departing from an acceleration ring - ¼ of your total ship weight
* Moving within the same orbit)- 1 fuel unit

When computing fuel costs, always round any fractional result up to the next whole number.

If you have too much cargo to move with your remaining fuel, you will need to dump some of it (in which case it is lost) or transfer it to another ship or storage depot on the same space and move without it. 

##Special actions
You may perform as many special actions as you like on your turn, provided you have cards for them. For each action you perform you must discard one action card to perform that action.

* Search the empty (no planets, stations, or infestors) space your ship occupies for resources by spinning the resource spinner. A resource is discovered if the spinner points to the resource are searching for, which depends on which ring you are currently in:

* Upgrade a storage ring to any other station type. Cost is same as above minus the metal (e.g. upgrade a ring to a fuel depot for 2 helium).
* Disassemble any constructed station and recover the metal
* Refit any ship on the same space (including your own) 

###Heavy lift:
<img src="https://rawgit.com/bjornicus/orbitalboardgame/master/ship-card[back].svg" width="100" height="100">

* Heavy lift ships have 2X the carrying capacity of other ships.
* Boost a ring, station, or depot you are docked with to a new orbit for a cost of 3 fuel + the normal movement cost for your ship. Storage rings must be empty to boost. Your ship may not re-fuel on the same turn.

##Infestors

###Adding
When an infestor card is drawn, take an infestor token of the corresponding color and place it on the board at the infestation point on the outermost orbit closest to where the player who drew the card is sitting.

###Moving
Infestors move one space per round closer to their target planet (first in to the target orbit then around that orbit). When moving around an orbit, the infestor will take the shortest path to the planet, peferring the orbital direction (counter clockwise) in the case where either direction is the same distance to the planet. 

If an infestor reaches a planet, that planet becomes infested and is no longer usable. 

If an infestor's target planet is already infested at the beginning of the infestor movement phase (i.e. before any infestors have moved this round), it targets the home planet.

##Winning or Losing
To win the game, you must construct enough orbital colonies to meet the expansion needs of your population.  Once constructed, colony provisions from the home planet must be delivered to a colony to make it ready to be inhabited.  The number of colonies you must construct depends on the difficulty you have chosen. The difficulty level also imposes constraints on how many planets you can allow to become infested.  Play continues until the draw pile is exhausted and all remaining action cards are used, or until one of the wining or losing condition is met.

###Winning
The game is won as soon as the players construct the requisite number of habitats:

Easy: Successfully construct and provision one orbital habitat.

Normal: Successfully construct and provision two orbital habitat. Do not lose more than two planets to infestation.

Hard: Successfully construct and provision three orbital habitat. Do not lose more than one planet to infestation.

###Losing
If the home planet becomes infested or more than the allowable number of other planets become infested, the game is lost. If the players are unable to construct the necesarry number of habitats before running out of action cards to spend the game is also lost.
