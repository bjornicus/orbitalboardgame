##Objective 
Collect and transport critical resources to construct an interstellar transport while defending the solar system against invaders. 

##Setup 
1. Place the four planets in their orbits (at a random location) 
1. Place all of the player's ships in orbit on the second planet (the home planet) 
1. Pull out the infstor cards and shuffle them, and divide the rest into three piles. Shuffle two infestor cards into pile one, four into pile two, and six into pile three. Stack the piles with pile three on bottom and pile one on top to form the draw pile. 

##Each Turn  
1. Draw a card (and add invaders if it says so) 
1. Do any of the following:
    * If you are at the home planet, or a refit depot, you may re-outfit your ship for a different role ( mining, engineer, interceptor, or heavy lift) 
    * Re-fuel your ship (if at the home planet or fuel depot) 
    * Exchange fuel, cards, or resources with other ships on your same space. 
    * Move your ship (once per turn)
    * Perform special actions (one per action card)

##Each Round 
1. Move infestor pieces. 
1. Orbit all ships, planets, stations, and infestors counter clockwise 

##Ship movement 
Move one space per turn (except interceptors, see below).

Movement costs are as follows: 
* Orbital transfer maneuver (changing orbits) - ½ of your total weight (fuel + cargo units) 
* Orbital transfers into planetary orbit - ¼ of your total ship weight 
* Orbital transit (within the same orbit)- 1 fuel unit 

If you have too much cargo to move with your remaining fuel, you will need to dump some of it or transfer it to another ship or storage depot on your same space and move without it.  

##Special actions (one card per action) 
###Mining ship:  
* Search the empty (no planets, depots, or invaders) space your ship occupies for resources by Rolling the die. A resource is discovered if the number rolled is less than or equal to the orbit number (e.g. 1 for innermost, 4 four outermost)  
    * If a resource is discovered, place a matching resource token in your cargo hold
* Extract resources from the planet you are orbiting (if not infested). One resource per card 
    * Water from the outermost planet 
    * Metals from the innermost planet 
    * Helium 3 from the third planet 
* Build a depot on the empty space your ship occupies  
    * Fuel depot cost: 2 He + 1 metal 
    * Storage ring cost: 1 metal 

###Engineer: 
* Build: 
    * Fuel depot or storage ring (same costs as above)
    * Refit stationt (1 water +1 metals +1 helium 3)
    * Interstellar transport (see winning) 
* Disassemble any constructed station and recover the metal
* Refit any ship on the same space (including your own) 

###Interceptor:  
* Destroy an invader ship on the same space (at any time, it need not be your turn) 
* Move an extra space 

###Heavy lift
* Heavy lift ships have 2X the carrying capacity of other ships (i.e. can fit two fuel or resource token in each cargo space).
* Boost a station you are docked to a new orbit for a cost of 3 fuel + the normal movement cost for your ship.  Your ship may not re-fuel on the same turn.

##Resources 
Metals can be found in the inner ring 
Helium is found in the third ring 
Water is found in the outer ring 

##Infestors
###Adding
When an infestor card is drawn, take an infestor token of the corresponding color and peace it on the board at the infestation point on the outermost orbit closest to the player who drew the card
###Moving
Infestors move one space per round closer to their target planet (first in to the target orbit then around that orbit) 

If an infestor reaches a planet, that planet becomes infested and is no longer usable. 

If an infestor's target planet is already infested at the beginning of the infestor movement phase (i.e. before any infestors have moved this round), it targets the home planet.

##Winning 
Successfully harvest and transport resources to the interstellar transport site: 

Easy: 4 water and 2 metals 

Normal: 6 water and 3 metals  

Hard: 8 water and 4 metals  

##Losing 
The home planet becomes infested or the players are unable to gather sufficient resources
