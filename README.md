##Setup 
1. Place the four planets somewhere in their respective orbits: metal planet (red) in the innermost orbit, home planet (earthlike) in the second orbit, helium planet (gas giant) in the third orbit, and ice planet in the outermont orbit.
1. Place all of the player's ships in orbit on the home planet.
1. Fuel up the ships by filling all of the spots on each player's ship mats with fuel tokens.
1. Separate 12 the infestor cards from the rest of the deck and shuffle them. Divide the rest of the deck (which now should contain only action cards) into three piles of 12. Shuffle two infestor cards into pile one, four into pile two, and six into pile three. Stack the piles with pile three on bottom and pile one on top to form the draw pile. 

##Rounds
A round of play consists of the following:
1. Infestor movement turn: move each infestor piece towards its target planet (see 'Infestor' section).
1. Player turns: each player takes a turn as described below. 
1. Orbit everything (all ships, planets, stations, and infestors) counter clockwise 

##Player Turns
Each player, on their turn takes the following steps:
1. Draw a card.  If it is an infestor card add an infestor to the board (See 'Infestors' section for details).  If it is an action card, keep it until you wish to use it to perform a special action (you may save it for a later turn if you like). 
1. Do any or all of the following:
    * If you are at the home planet, or a refit depot, you may re-outfit your ship for a different class.  To re-outfit simply choose the class you would like and place that classes marker on your ship mat (removing the previous one).  Available classs are miner, engineer, interceptor, or heavy lift.
    * Re-fuel your ship (if at the home planet or fuel depot) 
    * Exchange fuel, cards, or resources with other ships on your same space. 
    * Move your ship (once per turn)
    * Perform special actions specific to your ship's class (one per action card)

##Ship movement 
Move one space per turn (except interceptors, see Interceptor special actions).

Movement costs are as follows: 
* Orbital transfer maneuver (changing orbits) - ½ of your total weight (fuel + cargo units currently on board your ship) 
* Orbital transfers into planetary orbit - ¼ of your total ship weight 
* Orbital transit (within the same orbit)- 1 fuel unit 

When computing fuel costs, always round any fractional result up to the next whole number.

If you have too much cargo to move with your remaining fuel, you will need to dump some of it or transfer it to another ship or storage depot on your same space and move without it.  

##Special actions
You may perform as many special actions as you like on your turn, provided you have cards for them. For each action you must discard one action card to perform that action. 
###Mining ship:  
* Search the empty (no planets, depots, or invaders) space your ship occupies for resources by Rolling the die. A resource is discovered if the number rolled is less than or equal to the orbit number (e.g. 1 for innermost, 4 four outermost)  
    * If a resource is discovered, place a matching resource token in your cargo hold
* Extract resources from the planet you are orbiting (if not infested). One resource per card 
    * Water from the outermost planet 
    * Metals from the innermost planet 
    * Helium 3 from the third planet 
* Build a depot on the empty space your ship occupies  
    * Fuel depot cost: 2 He + 1 metal 
    * Storage ring cost: 1 metal 

###Engineer: 
* Build: 
    * Fuel depot or storage ring (same costs as above)
    * Refit stationt (1 water +1 metals +1 helium 3)
    * Interstellar transport (see winning) 
* Disassemble any constructed station and recover the metal
* Refit any ship on the same space (including your own) 

###Interceptor:  
* Destroy an invader ship on the same space.
* Move an extra space 

###Heavy lift
* Heavy lift ships have 2X the carrying capacity of other ships (i.e. can fit two fuel or resource token in each cargo space).
* Boost a station you are docked to a new orbit for a cost of 3 fuel + the normal movement cost for your ship.  Your ship may not re-fuel on the same turn.

##Resources 
Metals can be found in the inner ring 
Helium is found in the third ring 
Water is found in the outer ring 

##Infestors
###Adding
When an infestor card is drawn, take an infestor token of the corresponding color and place it on the board at the infestation point on the outermost orbit closest to where the player who drew the card is sitting.
###Moving
Infestors move one space per round closer to their target planet (first in to the target orbit then around that orbit). When moving around an orbit, the infestor will take the shortest path to the planet, peferring the orbital direction (counter clockwise) in the case where either direction is the same distance to the planet. 

If an infestor reaches a planet, that planet becomes infested and is no longer usable. 

If an infestor's target planet is already infested at the beginning of the infestor movement phase (i.e. before any infestors have moved this round), it targets the home planet.

##Winning 
Successfully harvest and transport resources to the interstellar transport site: 

Easy: 4 water and 2 metals 

Normal: 6 water and 3 metals  

Hard: 8 water and 4 metals  

##Losing 
The home planet becomes infested or the players are unable to gather sufficient resources
