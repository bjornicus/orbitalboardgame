Objective 

Collect and transport critical resources to construct an interstellar transport while defending the solar system against invaders. 

##Setup 

1. Place the four planets in their orbits (at a random location) 
1. Place 4 ships in orbit on the second planet (the home planet) 
1. Choose who will start the first round and put the "go first" tn in front of them 
1. Pull out face cards, shuffle the rest then divide into three ps. Shuffle two face cards into pile oe, four into pile two, and six into pile three. Stack the piles with pile three on bom and pile one on top to form the draw pile. 

##Each Turn  

1. Draw a card (and add invaders if it says so) 
1. Do any of the following:
    * If you are at the home planet, or at the appropriate refit depot, you may re-outfit your ship for a different role ( mining, engineer, or interceptor) 
    * Re-fuel your ship (if at the home planet or fuel depot) 
    * Exchange fuel, cards, or resources with other ships on your same space. 
    * Move your ship (once per turn)
    * Perform special actions (one per action card)

 

##Each Round 

1. Move invader ships one space closer to their target planet (first in to the target orbit then around that orbit) 
    If an invader reaches a planet, that planet becomes infested and is no longer usable. 
    If an invader's target planet is already infested at the beginning of the invader movement phase (i.e. before any invaders have moved this round), it targets the home planet 
1. Orbit all ships, planets, stations, and aliens counter clockwise 
1. Move "go first" token clockwise to the next player 

##Ship movement 

Move one space per turn (except interceptors, see below). 
Movement costs are as follows: 
    Orbital transfer maneuver (changing orbits) - ½ of your total weight (fuel + cargo units) 
    Orbital transfers into planetary orbit - ¼ of your total ship weight 
    Orbital transit (within the same orbit)- 1 fuel unit 
Orbital transfers to a higher orbit follow blue lines, to lower orbits follow the red lines. 
Maneuvers within the same orbit follow the green lines. 
If you have too much cargo to move with your remaining fuel, you will need to dump some it or transfer it to another ship or storage depot on your same space and move without it.  

##Special actions (one card per action) 

Mining ship:  
    Search the empty (no planets, depots, or invaders) space your ship occupies for resources by Rolling the die. A resource is discovered if the number rolled is less than or equal to the orbit number (e.g. 1 for innermost, 4 four outermost)  
        If a resource is discovered, place the resource in your cargo hold 
    Extract resources from the planet you are orbiting (if not infested). One resource per card 
        Water from the outermost planet 
        Metals from the innermost planet 
        Helium 3 from the third planet 
    Build a depot on the empty space your ship occupies  
        Fuel depot cost: 2 He + 1 metal 
        Storage depot cost: 1 metal 

Engineer: 
    Build: 
        Interstellar transport (see winning) 
        weapon depot (1 water +1 metals +1 helium 3) converts ships to interceptors 
        Mining depot converts ships to mining or prospecting (2 water + 1 metal) 
    Convert any constructed station back into its component resources 
    Refit any ship on the same space (including your own) 

Interceptor:  
    Destroy an invader ship on the same space (at any time, it need not be your turn) 
    Move an extra space 

Heavy boost  
    Heavy boost ships have 2X the carrying capacity of other ships. 
    Boost a station you are docked to a new orbit for a cost of 3 fuel.  Your ship does not  move with the station 

##Resources 

Metals can be found in the inner ring 
Helium is found in the third ring 
Water is found in the outer ring 

##Winning 

Successfully harvest and transport resources to the interstellar transport site: 
    Easy: 4 water and 2 metals 
    Normal: 6 water and 3 metals  
    Hard: 8 water and 4 metals  

 

##Losing 

The home planet becomes infested or the players are unable to gather sufficient resources
