      <li>
        Place a metal planet in the inner ring, the target plannet in the second right, a gas planet and a metal
        planet, or
        two gas planets in the third ring, and two ice planets in the outer ring.
      </li>
      <li>Place the colony ship and player ships on the outer ring space where the colony ship orbit transitions to the
        third ring.</li>
      <li>Give each player a ship card, tool token and an action indicator token; place the ship mat small ship side up
        and place the action indicator face up on the ship card.</li>
      <li>Place enough fuel tokens on each ship card to fill all of the spaces.</li>
      <li>Start the round timer (if using) and begin play</li>

      <h2>Player Turns</h2>
      <p>Players may take their turns each round in any order. During a turn each player may take <strong>one</strong>
        of the following actions:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Move</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Retool</strong> their ship (for mining <img class="circle" src="./class-marker1.png" width="40" />
            or building <img class="circle" src="./class-marker3.png" width="40" /> )</li>
          <li><strong>Mine</strong> a resource (if tooled for mining and at a resource planet)</li>
          <li><strong>Build</strong> a structure (if tooled for building* and carying sufficient resources)</li>
          <li><strong>Upgrade</strong> a ship (if tooled for building* and colocated with the ship being upgraded).
            Only
            an upgraded ship (<img style="vertical-align: middle" src="./ship-card[back].svg" width="40" />) can
            transport water</li>
        </ul>
        They may also do the following at any time:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Re-fuel</strong> (if at a station with a fuel module)</li>
          <li><strong>Transfer</strong> fuel or resources between colocated ships</li>
        </ul>
        Players may also roll the dice once to try to gain a bonus build or mine action. The roll can have the
        following outcomes:
        <ul>
          <li>1 or 2 - Their tool breaks and they will need to retool before building or mining again.</li>
          <li>3 or 4 - The attempt fails</li>
          <li>5 or 6 - The attempt succeeds and the player can proceed with the extra action</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Players indicate the have used their action (or are choosing not to) by turning their action token face down.
        When all action tokens are face down, everything orbits one space counter clockwise, players flip their action
        tokens up again, the round timer is restarted (if using), and a new round begins.</p>
      * When at a station equiped with an engineering module players may perform build actions reguardless of thier
      ship tooling.

    <p> At the beginning of a round, when the timer is started the following special events may occur:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Extreme solar activity</em> - players may not communicate with each other during the round (no talking
        about the game or pointing)</li>
      <li><em>Time Dialation</em> - the timer for this round is shorter than normal</li>
    </ul>
    If the timer expires before all players have turned their action tokens face down one of the following happens to a
    random player
    <ul>
      <li><em>Tool breakage</em> - the player's mining or build tool breaks and they must retool before using it</li>
      <li><em>Fuel leak</em> - the player's ship experiences a fuel leak and loses one fuel</li>

    <h2 id="winning-or-losing">Winning or Losing</h2>
    <h3 id="winning">Winning</h3>
    <p>Players win by collecting a sufficient amount of ice (<img src="./ice-token.png" width="50" height="50" class="circle" />)
      and transporting it to the target planet. The amound needed should be chosen at the beginning of the game based
      on desired difficulty.
      One or two per player is recommend.
    </p>

    <h3 id="losing">Losing</h3>
    <p>The players lose if the colony ship reaches the target planet before sufficient ice is delivered.</p>

    <h3 id="losing">Difficulty</h3>
    <p>There are several ways to adjust the difficulty aside from the amount of ice required to win. The round timer
      can be adjusted longer or shorter (for a more frantic game) or not used at all (for beginners or those who don't
      like time pressure). The number of resource planets in play can also be changed (use only one of each type for
      maximum challenge). The target planet can also be placed in the third orbit rather than the second to shorted the
      number of turns before the colony ship arrives </p>
